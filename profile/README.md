## Hi there 👋

We are Max² and we created this organization to show off our awesome web craft projects we
did together while doing our Master's degree. This org mainly exists to host our portfolio
of projects we did together.

## University of Applied Sciences Hagenberg 🎓

We studied in the University of Applied Sciences Hagenberg. We both graduated with our
Bachelor's in Software Engineering and our Master's in Interactive Media. The Master's
program was super nice for us because it let us choose freely what we can develop for our
semester projects.

The really nice aspect of the Master's program back then was, that a big focus lied on the
project work, which enabled us to choose really challenging topics to further improve our
coding skills.

## This organization 🤝

We decided that we create an organization to properly open source the code we wrote for
anybody to look at. Because we both are involved in the creation of the code, we figured
it would be the best solution to just create an organization.

👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
